## User Story
### AS A pet owner
I WANT a website where I can go to post pet care opportunities.
SO THAT, I can post opportunities for caregivers to take care on my pet when I am unable.  And as a caregiver I can offer my services by accepting posted opportunities to care for pets.
    

## Features
-  Utilizes sequelize for ORM to aid in creating and querying the database.
-  Uses express as the server.
-  The site maintains a database of users and requires login so that other users can see who created a post or comment.
